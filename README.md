# Singapore notes on the invariant trace formula for $SL(2)$

The Arthur-Selberg trace formula, conceived by [Atle Selberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atle_Selberg) and vastly generalized by [Jim Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Arthur_(mathematician)), is a very important tool to attempt [Langlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Langlands)' [Functoriality conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_program). 

I gave a mini-course on the Arthur-Selberg trace formula at the international conference - **[On the Langlands Program: Endoscopy and Beyond](https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/2018/lang/index.php)** at the National University of Singapore in December 2018. The course mainly focussed on discussing the geometric and spectral sides of the trace formula for the group **SL(2)** which has rank 1. The five lectures mainly covered the following. 

- **Lecture 1**: Introduction, the trace formula in the co-compact setting. [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxCCCt8BKcY)

- **Lecture 2**: Definition of the truncated kernel and convergence proof for **SL(2)**. [Video link[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9EHQqcrb8)

- **Lecture 3**: The geometric expansion - in terms of orbital integrals. [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5JSRGpzP0s)

- **Lecture 4**: The spectral side - representation theory. [Video link[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP6mV3sJk78)

- **Lecture 5**: The invariant trace formula - Reordering terms in the noninvariant trace formula to make the distributions invariant. [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP6mV3sJk78)

The repository hosts mainly two things, 
1. Lecture notes with the explicit invariant trace formula for the group **SL(2)**. This hasn't appeared in literature yet. 
2. Typographical errors in the excellent set of introductory notes by [Arthur](http://www.math.toronto.edu/arthur/) himself. 

The referee report for these notes is available and I am currently making the suggested changes. They will eventually be published into the conference proceedings. I intend to keep the repository up-to-date.
